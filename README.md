# Circuitpython HTTP Neopixel Animation

## A server controlling a strip of Neopixel LEDs.

The adafruit_httpserver library and other dependencies have to be [installed from the Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

MIT licensed libraries used: [Javascript Color Picker](https://github.com/ivanvmat/color-picker).

This code also uses an analog proximity sensor to increase the light for a short period of time when someone comes in front. That way you can have a nice LED animation around your library, and it will help you see what you are doing when you get close to retrieve something from it.

More info on adafruit_httpserver examples in the [http_demo](https://github.com/NeraSamples/circuitpython_http_demo) repository.
